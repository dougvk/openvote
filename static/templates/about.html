<p>Our choice of voting systems gives us bad outcomes.  With subtle changes to how we vote, new incentives will lead to better politics, better elections, and a stronger American democracy.</p>
<p>We are demonstrating "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">Approval Voting</a>" so that the public can experience the superior expression of their preferences as they vote:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Incentives for negative campaigning are <em>transformed</em> into incentives for candidates seeking approval.</li>
        <li>A vote for a third-party candidate is not a wasted vote.</li>
        <li>Power is shifted toward the candidates and away from their political parties.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Game Theory</h3>
<p>It's subtle, but it's important:  <br/>
    <dl>
        <dt>On the one hand</dt>
        <dd>
            If you are only allowed to vote for a single candidate, then centrists and similar candidates split votes and lose elections.  
            With more than 2 candidates the centrists spilit votes and have little chance of winning.  
            Elections quickly reduce to 2 candidates who tend to polarize voters, empowering 2 political parties to control their candidates.
            Campaigns use negative ads because they have to convince voters that they deserve a vote <i>and</i> their opponent does not.
        </dd>
        <dt>On the other hand</dt>
        <dd>
            If you are allowed to vote for any number of candidates, then you can vote for a third-party candidate without wasting your vote.
            You can still vote for a major party candidate as well.  More candidates can enter a race without distorting the votes for the others.
            Elections can include 3 or more candidates without creating a disadvantage for the centrists.  Politicians are empowered relative to their political parties.
            The goal of campaigning becomes convincing voters that you deserve their approval, with less incentive for negative campaigning.

<h3>What's the big deal?</h3>
<p>Radicalized politics has made the political parties into teams that play to win at the expense of the nation.  </p>
<p>At the root of this problem is the structure of our voting system.  </p>
<p>When citizens may only approve of a single candidate in an election, powerful unhealthy incentives can have an influence on candidates, campaigns, the media, and society.  </p>
<p>Third-party candidates have little chance of winning, and end up hurting their most similar mainstream candidate.  </p>
<p>By simply allowing voters to vote for as many of the candidates as they like, the incentives change and we get better elections.  </p>
