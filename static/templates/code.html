<h3>It's <a href="https://github.com/vonkohorn/openvote">Open Source</a></h3>
<br/>
<dd>It's fun to start from scratch and build something new using new tools.  It's a great way to learn.  OpenVote was developed by <a href="https://github.com/vonkohorn">Dan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dougvk">Doug</a> this way.  There are a lot of new frameworks we wanted to try.  We started with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for server API and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> for the client, but then saw <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/">angular.js</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hackernews</a> and refactored the client side of the application using that.  It's also the deepest integration with <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps API v3</a> that we've done, and has some intelligence behind the scenes inspired by the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/intelligence/">AI Meetup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
